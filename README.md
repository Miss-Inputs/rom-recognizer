# ROM Recognizer

Scans a directory (and subdirectories) of ROM files and identifies them against .dat files (such as those from [No-Intro](http://datomatic.no-intro.org/) or [Redump](http://redump.org/), which might not be redistributable, so they aren't included).

Shows results in a list (planned features: export to CSV, rename files from within ROM Recognizer). Supports ROMs in .zip files.

Don't pirate things yadda yadda yadda.
